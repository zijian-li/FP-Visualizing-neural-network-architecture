Project Commentory: This project is an integrated process, from brainstorming of ideas, to preprocessing of data accross different platforms and environments, to actual coding and computation, to visualization deployment on the webpage. Each step is very connected with others, and they all influence the final delivery largely. There was a large portion of time dedicated to debuging the code to compute the neural network values, and visualization also showed its power in our debugging process!

Acknowledgement

I would like to express our special thanks of gratitude to Prof. Jeffrey Heer for his professional planning and instruction of this course and as well as Matthew Conlen, Yang Liu, Sherry Wu and Halden Lin for all the help they offered as the teaching assistants. Our success would be impossible without their effort. 
Secondly we would also like to thank Dr. Callin Switzer who shared us with this golden project idea and generously offered his data. We appreciate the great ideas he provided through our discussion.
